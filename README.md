USN Bot is a versatile and customizable Python-powered Discord bot designed to enhance your server's functionality. Here are the key features:

Embed Creation: USN Bot allows you to generate rich embeds for messages. While the bot can’t create dynamic embeds on the fly, you can easily modify the embed’s content directly in the code. This feature is perfect for displaying important announcements, server news, or any custom information in a visually appealing format.

Server Application Creation: USN Bot can help streamline your server’s application process. You can create custom application forms tailored to your server's needs, from role applications to event sign-ups. The bot allows you to manage and track the submissions, ensuring a smooth and organized process.

Whether you need to display important information attractively or manage applications for your server, USN Bot is a great tool to streamline and personalize your server's experience.

Note: Requires discord.py
I'm not going to bother explaining how to setup bots so just look up a tutorial
You will need to customize everything in the code to your liking, the code provided is setup for a discord server I'm in, so you'll need to edit.
